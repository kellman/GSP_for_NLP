How to Heal Billing Errors

A single collection action on your credit report can inflict significant damage to your credit score. And that’s the case whether you’re waiting for your insurance company to pay a medical bill that went to collections, or if you’ve simply decided to ignore the bill.

This week’s Your Money column delves into the problem of medical billing errors and how that can affect your credit. It also looks at various pieces of legislation that would attempt to help consumers who have paid or settled the medical-related collections on their report.

In fact, one credit score maker recently decided to ignore collection actions on credit reports — more than half of which are typically tied to medical debts — as long as the collections have been paid. They aren’t doing it to help consumers, of course. Instead, they’ve found that looking at unpaid collections in concert with other variables is a better predictor of whether consumers are likely to default on their bills.

Has your credit score been hurt by medical bills or a collection related to medical billing errors? And do you think any of the legislative fixes mentioned in the column make sense?

This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
