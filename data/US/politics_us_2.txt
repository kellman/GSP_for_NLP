Report Says Drug Agents Attended Sex Parties
Drug Enforcement Administration agents attended sex parties with prostitutes, funded by local drug cartels on government-leased property overseas over several years, according to accounts by local police officers in a report by the Justice Department’s inspector general. A foreign officer who said he had arranged the parties alleged that several agents were given money, expensive gifts and weapons. Seven agents admitted attending the parties, the report said, and were suspended for two to 10 days. The report does not identify the country where the parties were said to have occurred, but it refers to prostitution “tolerance zones,” which are a fixture in cities in Colombia. The inspector general also raised concerns about how the D.E.A. and other agencies had handled allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct in several other cases
