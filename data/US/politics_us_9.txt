Bank of England Warns of Risks From Greece and Market Liquidity
LONDON — The Bank of England said Thursday that Britain’s stability continued to be threatened by international risks, including Greece’s financing needs, China’s slowdown and potentially inadequate market liquidity.

“Any of these risks could trigger abrupt shifts in global risk appetite that in turn might lead to a sudden reappraisal of underlying vulnerabilities in highly indebted economies, or sharp adjustments in financial markets,” the bank said in a statement accompanying the latest meeting of its Financial Policy Committee.

The committee, which was set up to monitor systemic risks in the financial system, said that credit growth in Britain remained moderate and that the country’s banks were increasingly more resilient. Risks around the housing market have abated, though household indebtedness remains high, the report said.

But it flagged international risks, specifically in Europe where signs of recovery have not placated fears of persistently low growth. China’s slowdown and the standoff in Greece over its debts could pose dangerous trigger points, the report said. The Prudential Regulation Authority, which is part of the Bank of England, is factoring in these risks in developing a framework for its 2015 stress test, which is due out on Monday.

The committee also raised concerns about market liquidity, noting that investors were buying and pricing some securities based on the idea that selling them again would be fairly easy, even though “liquidity in some markets may have become more fragile.”

Trading volumes in fixed-income markets have fallen relative to market size. A sudden, brief plunge in the 10-year Treasury yield in October raised concerns over whether a lack of liquidity was exacerbating volatility.

The group has asked the country’s regulators to gather information from British asset managers on how they would manage their liquidity in the event of stress event.

Concerns have been raised that although banks have reduced their inventory of bonds, an increasing number of individuals have invested in vehicles like exchange-traded-funds, which often can be redeemed daily. If the banks are not willing to step in and buy in a volatile environment and investors rush to sell, the effect could be dire, some have warned.

More information from the asset managers “would inform assessment of the extent to which markets are reliant on investment funds offering redemptions at short notice,” it said.

The group specifically addressed concerns about risks in the commercial real estate and leveraged loan market. London commercial property values have soared in the last two years. But the committee concluded that yields were not unusually low and debt financing had not increased enough to warrant concern. Additionally, British banks have a smaller piece of the debt financing pie.

The group said underwriting standards in the leveraged loan market had fallen as measured by loan-to-value and interest coverage ratios, but not yet to the point of warranting a policy response.

“Were that trend to continue, U.K. banks could quickly become less resilient to stress in these markets,” it concluded, adding that it would monitor the situation.

Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, said in a letter to the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, that over the next year, the group would review how banks’ capital buffers were calibrated and carry out its annual assessment of financial stability risks and regulation “beyond the core banking system” later in 2015.

Mr. Carney, who is also chairman of Financial Stability Board, said after a meeting of the board in Frankfurt on Thursday that its members had raised concerns about liquidity.

“Members noted current concerns about rising risks stemming from the overestimation by investors of the degree of liquidity fixed-income markets as well as the growth of assets under management in funds that offer on-demand redemptions but invest in less liquid assets,” he said.
