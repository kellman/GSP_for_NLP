Deputies Said to Taunt Prisoners
San Francisco’s public defender called on Thursday for an independent investigation into the Sheriff’s Department after accusations that four deputies forced prisoners to engage in “gladiator-style fights” for their own amusement.

Jeff Adachi, the public defender, said at a news conference that the deputies forced the smallest prisoner, Rico Palikiko Garcia, who weighs 150 pounds, to fight the largest prisoner, Stanly Harris, who weighs 350 pounds.

They also “appeared to delight” in taunting Mr. Harris with jokes about his weight, the public defender’s office said in a statement, and forced him to participate in “boot camp-style exercises.”

“It was a sadistic pleasure,” Mr. Adachi said in a telephone interview. “This was like something right out of ‘Game of Thrones.’ ”

The prisoners were told they would be rewarded with a hamburger if they won, but would be sprayed with Mace, severely beaten and transferred to dangerous housing quarters if they refused to fight at all, he said. Both men were injured in the fights but were told they would be beaten if they sought medical attention.

Mr. Garcia, the smaller inmate, suffered fractured ribs, Mr. Adachi said.

All four deputies were transferred to other prisons on Thursday morning before the public defender’s office made its accusations against them, Mr. Adachi said. Both Mr. Garcia and Mr. Harris were also moved to new prisons.

Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi could not be reached for comment, and the San Francisco Police Officers Association did not respond to a request for comment.
