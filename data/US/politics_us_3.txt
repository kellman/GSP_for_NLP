Illinois: Jesse Jackson Jr. Leaves Prison
Former Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. left an Alabama federal prison early Thursday bound for a halfway house, two years after pleading guilty to spending $750,000 in campaign money on personal items. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who went to the minimum security prison camp at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery to pick up his son, a Democrat who served in Congress from 1995 to 2012, said they had a “joyous reunion.” After Mr. Jackson, 50, is officially no longer a prisoner, his wife, Sandra, will serve a year in prison on a related conviction. A former Chicago alderman, she was sentenced for filing false joint federal income tax returns. In a concession to the couple’s two children, a judge allowed the Jacksons to stagger their sentences.
