Texas: Judge Blocks Benefits for Gay Couples
A judge has temporarily blocked federal rules that would expand medical leave benefits to some same-sex couples. In a ruling Thursday in Wichita Falls, Judge Reed Oâ€™Connor of Federal District Court granted a preliminary injunction that stays expansion of the definition of spouse under the Family and Medical Leave Act to include same-sex couples. Texas filed suit last week to block the change, which was to take effect on Friday. Attorney General Ken Paxton argued that complying would have forced state agencies to either violate federal rules or a 2005 ban on same-sex marriage in the Texas Constitution. Arkansas, Louisiana and Nebraska joined the lawsuit. A Justice Department spokeswoman said it was not clear how many states are affected.
