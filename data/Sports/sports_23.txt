Arizona Beats Xavier, Setting Up Rematch With Wisconsin in Regional Final
LOS ANGELES — In a tournament in which one loss means elimination, Arizona’s situation is as close as a team can get to a do-over.

A year ago, the Wildcats were cruising through the N.C.A.A. tournament bracket as a title contender, a potent blend of youth and experience, when they arrived in Southern California for the round of 16. On a Thursday night in Anaheim, the Wildcats eliminated San Diego State.

Two nights later in the regional final, Arizona, trying to reach the Final Four for the first time since 2001, lost to Wisconsin, 64-63, in overtime.

“When you lose, it’s like a car crashes,” Coach Sean Miller said that night. “You’re done.”

Now, Arizona (34-3) has a rare chance to repair some of the emotional damage that has lingered for a year.

The Wildcats, seeded second in the West Region, narrowly beat No. 6 Xavier, 68-60, on Thursday night to reach the regional final. The Musketeers clung to small leads through much of the second half, but Arizona outscored Xavier, 21-7, over the final 7 minutes 25 seconds to advance.
