Coach K Will Win and Lose
HOUSTON — Coach K wants Duke to beat Utah. Coach K also wants Utah to beat Duke. No matter what happens, Coach K will be pleased.

It is less confusing than it seems. That sobriquet, long synonymous with the Blue Devils boss Mike Krzyzewski, belongs to another coach of Polish extraction, Larry Krystkowiak, whose fourth-seeded Utes play top-seeded Duke in a South Regional semifinal Friday in Houston.

“On the sideline, you might have to watch out for that,” Duke guard Tyus Jones said.

Jones said Krzyzewski never told his players to call him Coach K. It was just understood, he said, and, besides, it was easier than saying Krzyzewski over and over. Answering a question about the coaches Thursday, Utah center Dallin Bachynski paused to collect his thoughts.

“I’ve got to make sure I say Krzyzewski and Krystkowiak so I don’t get them mixed up right now,” Bachynski said.

The coaches share heritage and consonant-loaded surnames, and each endured a humble start in his current job before finding success. But they did not meet until last summer, in Las Vegas. Krystkowiak said he bumped into Krzyzewski at a 7-Eleven. Perhaps, Krzyzewski said.

“I’m not saying it didn’t — I would never diss another Polish-American,” Krzyzewski said. “Probably give him our secret handshake. I’m not going to tell you what it is.”

These matters came up earlier this season, when Krystkowiak called in to Krzyzewski’s weekly program on Sirius XM, “Basketball and Beyond with Coach K.” They chatted about their backgrounds as much as basketball. At one point during their conversation, Krystkowiak told Krzyzewski that in the early 1980s, when he played at Montana, he would flip the channel during Duke games because the Blue Devils were not “exactly dazzling anybody.”

“Now it’s the opposite,” Krystkowiak said. “When they’re on, it’s hard for me to change the channel because I really respect what they’ve done.”

UTAH PREPARES FOR OKAFOR Utah has played against some talented centers. Josh Smith of Georgetown. Tony Parker of U.C.L.A. Kaleb Tarczewski of Arizona. There are others. None compare to Jahlil Okafor of Duke.

“I don’t think I’ve played against a versatile post player like that before,” Utah center Jakob Poeltl said.

Okafor, 6 feet 11 and 270 pounds, combines grace and dexterity with touch and instinct. Only once has he scored fewer than 10 points this season — in Duke’s first two N.C.A.A. tournament games, he torched Robert Morris and San Diego State for 54 points on 21 of 27 shooting — and he leads the Blue Devils in rebounding.

Finding someone to simulate Okafor during practice is almost as difficult as guarding him. That task has fallen mainly to the backup centers Dallin Bachynski and Jeremy Olsen, who try to accentuate Okafor’s tendencies.

Olsen described his responsibility as: “I have to use the left hand and right hand; be able to have great vision; to pass if I’m getting pressure. But he can also dribble and handle a bit if he senses pressure, so he might back down and try to take you 1-on-1 on the perimeter.”

Olsen and Bachynski said it was not easy emulating Georgetown’s Smith, who is 7 feet and 350 pounds. But Utah held him to 8 points, below his season average, in its victory last round.

“We’re always pretty prepared for the teams we’re playing,” Olsen said. “When we get there, it’s like we know everything the other team’s trying to do and we’re able to do take it away. That’s why we’re one of the best defensive teams in the country. We pride ourselves on taking away what the other teams want to do.”

GONZAGA CELEBRATES, AS USUAL Coach Mark Few listened to the question and winced, genuinely unamused that Gonzaga’s inner sanctum had been breached. His locker-room handstand to celebrate the second-seeded Bulldogs’ victory against Iowa was captured on video by forward Kyle Wiltjer and posted on Twitter, where it quickly acquired a name and directed attention to the person Few dislikes most being in the spotlight: himself.

“Do the Few” became an instant sensation, and students were suddenly breaking into spontaneous handstands across the Spokane, Wash., campus.

But Few stopped as he walked to practice ahead of Friday’s South Regional matchup with No. 11 U.C.L.A. and wanted to set the record straight.

“Lost in that whole thing was, we’ve been celebrating with stuff like that for seven, eight years now,” Few said.

Amid all of Gonzaga’s success and what has become a run of 17 consecutive trips to the N.C.A.A. tournament — 16 of those under Few — he believed expectations were so burdensome that the Bulldogs were becoming joyless in victory.

“It was borne out of the moment and borne out of the expectations for Gonzaga to always win,” Few said. “It was like everybody was working in a mill and grinding through the day, and we finally get off our shift at 4 o’clock and nobody’s feeling any emotion.”

Few cannot pinpoint exactly when he did his first handstand or when the players and coaches began breaking into celebration, but it has become a tradition of sorts, an unscripted moment when the Bulldogs bond in a group setting. He said it could happen just as easily after a last-second shot to beat a last-place team as it could occur after beating a top-ranked opponent.

“Let’s celebrate these times and being together and have players feel good about themselves,” Few said. “We want to encourage that enthusiasm. Especially with this group. They’re a pretty stoic group.”

Few could not recall which games elicited the behavior, but he estimated that players and coaches broke into a similar celebration seven or eight times. He said he did not “Do the Few” after Gonzaga’s 87-74 victory at U.C.L.A. in December.

Gonzaga made its first tournament appearance in 1995 and has reached it every year since 1999, 18 in all. Five times the Bulldogs have reached the round of 16, but they have never been able to crack the Final Four, which would warrant a few handstands. TOM SPOUSTA

BRUINS SEEK REVENGE U.C.L.A. has won two games to face Gonzaga in a South regional semifinal here Friday night, but it is still miffed at the disrespect and criticism it received for being invited to the tournament.

“Two weeks ago, it was how you didn’t deserve it,” Bruins Coach Steve Alford said. “Now it’s a love-fest.”

Revenge will be part of the narrative against Gonzaga, too.

“They picked us apart and were pretty physical,” forward Kevon Looney said.

The Bruins say that loss was a turning point in their season, and they morphed into a team that should not have had to sweat out a tournament bid.

“A lot of teams were on the bubble,” Looney said. “We were the only ones that got that kind of backlash. We want to prove everybody wrong.” TOM SPOUSTA
